        <p>More about this video: This was filmed in 2022 after the pandemic had calmed down. A friend of mine had taken the liberty to organize a get-together among the music lovers and performers to appreciate the talent mainly in our neighborhood. I had partnered up with Aaron to film this and compose, although he was mainly in charge of the first part, I was in charge of the second part.</p>
