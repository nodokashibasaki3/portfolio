        <section class="project-description">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>I developed an application dedicated to grade calculation. While tools such as those provided by others facilitate the 
                computation of scores necessary for acing final examinations, they fall short in addressing the requirements 
                of evaluating the daily assignments.

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>Coded with simple HTML and CSS in a single index.html file after an equation to calculate required assignment grade to reach a desired grade.</p>

            <h2>Demo</h2>
            <iframe src="../../assignment calculator/index.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>         
            <p> To validate the functionality of my application, I utilized the "what-if-grade" feature on Canvas. This feature allows the input of 
                theoretical grades for assignments to project the potential final grade based on these inputs. You might question the necessity of my HTML 
                code given the existence of this Canvas function. The rationale lies in the limitation of the Canvas feature, which depends on the professor's 
                upload of the assignment onto Canvas. For instance, in my healthcare class, I have a project assigned. However, the professor hasn't created 
                the assignment tab to Canvas, rendering it absent from the Canvas grade book. This absence prohibits any speculative calculation of the grade I might receive.

        <section class="project-conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project was enjoyable and straightforward, proving to be beneficial in my everyday academic pursuits. In the next stages of research and 
                development, with an emphasis on enhancing the user interface, determining the percentage weight of assignments within a category could pose a 
                challenge. It would be ideal to devise a user-friendly method that allows users to easily calculate this without the need for additional external computations.
